```

This is a little web app in Shiny to illustrate maximum likelihood estimation via simulation. It generates samples from a Bernoulli, Poisson, or Normal random variable.  It takes a single parameter as input, and shows the value counts and negative log-likelihood for the first sample, and the MLEs, confidence intervals, and CI coverage over all samples.  It is accessible at https://genpopsim.shinyapps.io/Maximum_likelihood_estimation/.

### Things to do

- It needs to exclude confidence intervals that cross parameter boundaries, and for boundary estimates, from plot and coverage calculations.
