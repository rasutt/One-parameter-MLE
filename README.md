Maximum Likelihood in Shiny
================

This is a little web app in Shiny to illustrate maximum likelihood
estimation via simulation. It generates samples from a Bernoulli,
Poisson, or Normal random variable. It takes a single parameter as
input, and shows the value counts and negative log-likelihood for the
first sample, and the MLEs, confidence intervals, and CI coverage over
all samples. It is accessible at
