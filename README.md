Maximum Likelihood in Shiny
================

This is a little web app in Shiny to illustrate maximum likelihood
estimation. It has two parameter inputs, and generates samples of a
dependent variable given those parameters and an independent variable.
It shows the samples, and the likelihood function implied over the
parameters.
